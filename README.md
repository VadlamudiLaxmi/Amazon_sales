Welcome to the Amazon Sales Analysis project! Here, we delve into examining sales data sourced from Amazon to extract actionable insights and trends aimed at optimizing sales strategies, understanding customer behavior, and enhancing overall business operations.

## Overview
This project is focused on analyzing a dataset containing Amazon sales records, including the crucial details like sales dates, customer particulars, product categories, and revenue statistics. My main objective is to address various questions and uncover valuable insights from the dataset by using SQL queries and robust data analysis techniques.

## Dataset Synopsis
The dataset utilized for this project represents diverse Amazon sales transactions. Alongside the sales data, the dataset also consists of the information concerning customers, products, orders, and returns. Prior to analysis, rigorous preprocessing procedures were implemented to rectify missing values and ensure optimal data quality.

## Analytical Queries
During the analysis, the following key questions were addressed using SQL queries and data
analysis techniques:

1.Find out the top 5 customers who made the highest profits.
2. Find out the average quantity ordered per category.
3. Identify the top 5 products that have generated the highest revenue.
4.Determine the top 5 products whose revenue has decreased compared to the previous year.
5.Identify the highest profitable sub-category.
6. List the products that not been sold yet
7. Determine the month with the highest number of orders.
8. Calculate the profit margin percentage for each sale (Profit divided by Sales).
9. Calculate the percentage contribution of each sub-category.
10. Identify the top 2 categories that have received maximum returns and their return percentage.   

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) has been developed to visually illustrate the relationship between the tables within the dataset. This diagram offers a comprehensive understanding of the data structure, helping in the identification of key entities and their attributes.

## Getting Started
To replicate the analysis or delve deeper into the dataset, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.Ensure the availability of a SQL environment for executing queries.
3.Load the provided dataset into your SQL database.
4.Execute the SQL queries provided in the repository to analyze the data and derive insights.
5.Customize the analysis or queries as per your specific objectives.

## Conclusion
Through this project, our aim is to provide valuable insights into Amazon sales trends, customer preferences, and important factors influencing e-commerce operations. By analysing the dataset and addressing key questions, we aspire to help stakeholders in making informed decisions and refining their sales strategies.
